# storybook-aem

Storybook-aem is a command line application - CLI - that is used with [@storybook/aem](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@storybook/aem). It provides useful commands that will speed up your workflow.

## Installation
To install `storybook-aem` run `npm install storybook-aem -g` from the directory with your `package.json` file. Also add it to your project as a development dependency.

## Commands
There are several commands provided by `storybook-aem`. You can find a list of them by running `storybook-aem` from your terminal. Or by running the `storybook-aem help` command. Ensure you are running the `storybook-aem` commands from the folder with your `package.json` file.

```

### Init
TKTKTK More description and refactoring of the `init` command is to come.

### Story
The `storybook-aem story` command is the most used command provided. Running this command will provide you with a series of prompts to get started adding stories. It will ask for which component and type of component you want to make stories. From there it will create the story definition, and if desired, will also create content in AEM for your story.

### Package
The `storybook-aem package` command comes with two subcommands - `install` and `export`. When configured, you can use these commands to manage the content for your stories in AEM. If you add an additional step to your maven build, you can also install the content package automatically.

To set this up you first need to create a package in the [AEM package manager](http://localhost:4502/crx/packmgr/index.jsp) that is configured with filters that include the content needed for your stories. Then you will need to configure and run the `storybook-aem package export` command as explained below. After this you should add any .content.xml files that are unnecessary to your .gitignore to avoid unnecessary content from being saved to the code base and to avoid merge conflicts.

#### Package Export

The `storybook-aem package export` command will rebuild the specified content package and then download the contents to the configured location in your codebase. The zip file will not be be retained, instead the `jcr_root` and `META-INF` will be saved to the codebase. This should allow for both manual changes and easy version control of the content.

This command requires that a `localPackagePath` configuration be added to the `storybook-aem` section of your `package.json` file. This configuration should point to the directory within the codebase that you want to save the package to. This directory should not contain anything other than the `jcr_root`, and `META-INF` directories of the package, as created by the `export` command. It is suggested to point this configuration at a `.storybook/aem-library` directory, which will need manually created.

#### Package Install

The `storybook-aem package install` command will create an AEM package from the `localPackagePath` directory as explained in the previous section. It will POST this content package zip file into AEM and replicate it for use in AEM. By default, the install command will also open your default browser to the package content that was just installed. You can pass the `--quiet` option to prevent this.

This command required that a `aemContentPath` configuration be added to the `storybook-aem` section of your `package.json` file. This is the path that will be opened with the Site Editor in AEM after the package is installed.

#### Package and Maven
See the [example.pom.xml](https://github.com/icfnext/storybook-aem/tree/master/packages/storybook-aem/example.pom.xml) file to see how you can add a maven build profile to take advantage of the `storybook-aem package` command. The example adds support for a new maven profile `install-storybook` that can be used like so: `mvn clean install -P install-storybook`. Additionally, this [example.pom.xml](https://github.com/icfnext/storybook-aem/tree/master/packages/storybook-aem/example.pom.xml) expects two scripts in the package.json file:

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "storybook-library:install-maven": "storybook-aem package install --quiet",
    "storybook-library:export": "storybook-aem package export",
  }
}
```

### Version
The `storybook-aem version` command shows the installed version of `storybook-aem` you are using. On every command ran, there is a check if the latest version of `storybook-aem` is installed.

### Help
The `storybook-aem help <subcommand>` command will show the help documentation for `storybook-aem` or the specified subcommand.
